## 2-vertex-strongly-biconnected
A strongly biconnected directed graph G=(V,E) is 2-vertex strongly biconnected[5] if G has at least three vertices and G\{w} is strongly biconnected for all vertices w in G.

## Task
Step 1: An implementation of the Cheriyan-Mehlhorn-Gabow algorithm[1,2,3] for finding strongly connected components of a directed graph in linear time.

Step 2: An implementation of Jens Schmidt's algorihm[4] for testing whether an undirected graph is 2-connected(That means it has no articulation points) in linear time

Step 3: Testing whether a directed graph is 2-vertex strongly biconnected or not in time O(n(n+m)).

#### Working on this homework was quite challenging, especially given our diverse programming backgrounds. Each team member is proficient in different programming languages, which made merging everything into a unified language a complex task. Nonetheless, it was a valuable learning experience that pushed us to collaborate effectively and leverage our collective skills.
